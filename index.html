<p><b>Human Capital Effects of Corporate Climate Exposure</b> [<a href="papers/Li_Climate_Labor.pdf">PDF</a>]</p>
<p></p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px"; align="justify";>This paper investigates how firms' climate change exposures affect their innovative employees. By analyzing climate exposures extracted from conference call transcripts using machine learning, I find that departure rates of inventors are higher for firms that are more exposed to physical climate shocks. After the departure of such high-skilled workers, firms' innovative productivity declines and subsequent patents become less valuable. Moreover, such a brain drain effect is more pronounced among inventors who are more concerned about climate change and when climate awareness is higher. Overall, the results indicate that corporate physical climate exposure has significant impacts on the mobility of talents across firms and the value of innovative human capital.</p>

<p><b>Climate Laws and Cross-Border Mergers and Acquisitions</b> (with Dragon Yongjun Tang and Fei Xie) [<a href="papers/LiTangXie.pdf">PDF</a>]</p>
<p></p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px"; align="justify";>Climate-related regulations have become increasingly prevalent worldwide. However, the nature of climate as a global public good makes it unclear to what extent these regulations are enforced by individual countries and whether they influence key corporate decisions. We examine the impact of climate laws on the international market for corporate control. We find that foreign acquirers are less likely to pursue targets in countries that have enacted climate laws and that deals announced shortly before the enactment of climate laws are more likely to be withdrawn. Furthermore, cross-border deals feature smaller synergies, lower premiums, and less post-merger operating performance improvement after target countries enact climate laws. We uncover support for three potential mechanisms through which climate regulations affect cross-border acquisitions, including impeding synergy creation, deterring carbon leakage through regulatory arbitrage, and their selective enforcement.</p>

<p><b>It Depends on Where You Post: Stock Message Boards and the Cross-section of Stock Returns</b> (with Yuqin Huang, Feng Li, and Tse-Chun Lin) [New Draft Coming Soon]</p>
<p></p>  
<p style="padding-left: 20px"; align="justify";>We examine the information transmission from local investors to nonlocal investors with a large dataset on stock message board postings. We show that abnormal relative postings, i.e., unusual changes in the volume of postings from local versus nonlocal investors, capture locals' information advantage. The results show that posting activities mainly reflect good news, potentially due to social transmission bias Hirshleifer (2020) and short-sales constraints. Moreover, abnormal relative postings positively predict stock returns of peer firms headquartered in the same city. The economic value of local information advantage is non-trivial and lasts for a few weeks. Overall, our findings suggest that local investors transmit their geography-based private information to nonlocal investors through interactions on social media.</p>
