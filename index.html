<h2>Working Papers</h2>
<p><b>Climate Laws and Cross-Border Mergers and Acquisitions</b> (with Dragon Yongjun Tang and Fei Xie) [<a href="papers/LiTangXie.pdf">PDF</a>]</p>
<p></p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px"; align="justify";>Climate-related regulations have become increasingly prevalent worldwide. However, the nature of climate as a global public good makes it unclear to what extent these regulations are enforced by individual countries and whether they influence key corporate decisions. We examine the impact of climate laws on the international market for corporate control. We find that foreign acquirers are less likely to pursue targets in countries that have enacted climate laws and that deals announced shortly before the enactment of climate laws are more likely to be withdrawn. Furthermore, cross-border deals feature smaller synergies, lower premiums, and less post-merger operating performance improvement after target countries enact climate laws. We uncover support for three potential mechanisms through which climate regulations affect cross-border acquisitions, including impeding synergy creation, deterring carbon leakage through regulatory arbitrage, and their selective enforcement.</p>

<p><b>ESG Considerations in Acquisitions and Divestitures: Corporate Responses to Mandatory ESG Disclosure</b> (with Qilin Peng and Luping Yu) [<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4376676">PDF</a>]</p>
<p></p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px"; align="justify";>As demands for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data grow, mandatory ESG disclosure regulations are becoming more prevalent globally. However, corporate responses to these regulations remain unclear. Our ChatGPT-based analysis reveals a notable increase in ESG-related discussions during merger and acquisition conference calls after the implementation of ESG disclosure mandates. In conjunction with these heightened discussions, firms strategically modify their portfolio of productive assets through acquisitions and divestitures. They acquire assets with superior ESG performance and divest underperforming assets, particularly in the wake of negative ESG incidents. Firms subjected to these mandates are willing to offer higher premiums when acquiring assets with strong ESG attributes and to accept discounts when divesting assets with weaker ESG performance. Notably, our findings demonstrate that acquisitions are more effective than divestitures in driving improvement in ESG performance and enhancing overall firm value.</p>

<p><b>Human Capital Effects of Corporate Climate Exposure</b> [<a href="papers/Li_Climate_Labor.pdf">PDF</a>]</p>
<p></p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px"; align="justify";>This paper investigates how firms' climate change exposures affect their innovative employees. By analyzing climate exposures extracted from conference call transcripts using machine learning, I find that departure rates of inventors are higher for firms that are more exposed to physical climate shocks. After the departure of such high-skilled workers, firms' innovative productivity declines and subsequent patents become less valuable. Moreover, such a brain drain effect is more pronounced among inventors who are more concerned about climate change and when climate awareness is higher. Overall, the results indicate that corporate physical climate exposure has significant impacts on the mobility of talents across firms and the value of innovative human capital.</p>

<p><b>Local Information Advantage and Stock Returns: Evidence from Social Media</b> (with Yuqin Huang, Feng Li, and Tse-Chun Lin) [New Draft Coming Soon]</p>
<p></p>  
<p style="padding-left: 20px"; align="justify";>We examine the information asymmetry between local and nonlocal investors with a large dataset of stock message board postings. We document that abnormal relative postings of a firm, i.e., unusual changes in the volume of postings from local versus nonlocal investors, capture locals' information advantage. This measure positively predicts firms' short-term stock returns as well as those of peer firms in the same city. Posting activities primarily reflect good news, potentially due to social transmission bias and short-sales constraints. We identify the information driving return predictability through content-based analysis. Abnormal relative postings also lead analysts' forecast revisions. Overall, investors' interactions on social media contain valuable geography-based private information.</p>
